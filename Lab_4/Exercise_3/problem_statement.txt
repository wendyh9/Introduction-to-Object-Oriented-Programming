You are now going to create a LinkedList class, that will work very similarly to the Stack class 
seen in the book and used in the previous exercise.

Write new methods as follows:

- add( LinkedList::Link* l, int n ): will insert in the linked list, after link l, a chain of n 
new links. Each link will store an integer that will be set to receive, in order, a value starting 
from 0 until n-1. In the last link of the list always set the next pointer to be NULL in order to 
mark the end of the list.

- print(): this method moves through the entire list printing out each integer value stored in 
the links.

- cleanup(): updated cleanup function that will automatically delete all links in the linked list, 
including the data stored on each link. (Ignore the problems related to deleting void* for now.)

Your linked list struct should be named LinkedList and should be saved in a header file named 
LinkedList.h. The file linkedLists.cpp will be used to evaluate your struct.
