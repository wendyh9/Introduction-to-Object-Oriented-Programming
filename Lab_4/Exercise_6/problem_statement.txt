Create a struct named AddressBook that stores multiple Entry structs (that you created in the 
previous exercise). Your code must be saved in a file named AddressBook.h and should reuse 
your code from Entry.h.

Member functions for AddressBook should be able to add an entry and print all the entries in 
the address book. Your code will be tested with the file addressBook.cpp, which reads in several 
entries from standard input, stores them in an AddressBook instance and prints them all out.
