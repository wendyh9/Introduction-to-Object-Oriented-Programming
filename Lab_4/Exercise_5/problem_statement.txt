Create a struct named Entry that stores an entry of an address book. It should have fields for 
first name, last name, and email address. Provide the appropriate getter and setter functions for 
each one of the fields. In addition provide a function called print. This function should print out 
the information in the struct in the way it appears in the sample.

Your code should go into a file named Entry.h with all the member functions implemented inline 
(in the header file). Your code will be tested using the file address_book_entry.cpp.
