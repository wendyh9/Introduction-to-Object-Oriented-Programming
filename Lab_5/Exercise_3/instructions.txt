More on Inheritance

Suppose we wish to store several different animals in an array. We do not know ahead of time what animals they will be. 
C++ will allow us to create a vector of pointers to Animal, and store in that vector any object of type Animal or a 
descendant of Animal.

Reuse the Animal.h and Dog.h files from the previous exercise and get the display.h file. Then write a C++ program that 
reads in an integer N. This is followed by N lines, where each line contains a character, a string, and an integer, 
separated by spaces. The character will either have the value A or D, indicating whether the animal described on this 
line is a generic animal or a dog. The string and the integer describe the animal's name and age, respectively.

For each line of input, instantiate the appropriate object and push it to the vector of pointers to Animal that you have 
created. Once you have pushed all the animals to the vector, call the display function, found in display.h, with your 
vector passed as an argument.
