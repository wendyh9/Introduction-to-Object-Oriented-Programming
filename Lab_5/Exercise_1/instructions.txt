Getters and Setters

Create a C++ class named Circle in a file called Circle.h. Your class should have three private double variables (x, y, 
and r). The variables x and y will store the Cartesian position of the center of the circle and the variable r will store 
the radius.

You should also add a public variable, area, which will store the area of the circle. There should be two constructors, 
one that takes no arguments and instantiates a unit circle centered at the origin. The second constructor should take in 
three arguments (for x, y and r) and instantiate a circle of radius r, centered at (x, y).

There should be getters and setters for all the private variables. Your code will be tested with the circles.cpp file.
