Constructors/Destructors

Extend the Stack class given in the book in order for it to store double numbers (instead of void* pointers). Add a 
destructor that will delete all the stack by making calls to pop(), and for each element destroyed the element will be 
printed to the output. Now add two constructors: the default one that will create an empty stack, and another one that 
will receive an integer n and will build a stack of n elements, such that the first element is 1.0, and the next ones are 
incremented by 0.1. Upload your Stack class, which will be tested for correctness with stacks.cpp.
