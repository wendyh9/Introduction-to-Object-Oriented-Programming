Inheritance in C++

The file Animal.h contains an Animal class that stores the name and age of a generic animal. Besides the appropriate 
constructors, getters, and setters, it has a function called feed() which prints out the message "Some food, please!"

Dogs are one kind of animal, so we can extend the Animal class to produce a Dog class. Create a Dog class which inherits 
from the Animal class and change its constructor and destructor to print more appropriate messages and change the feed() 
function to print a message saying "Dog food, please!"

Your class should be stored in a file called Dog.h. Your solution will be tested with the file animals.cpp.
