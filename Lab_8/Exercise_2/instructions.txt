Sortable Objects

Study the file Sortable.h. It contains a simple abstract class called Sortable, which will act as a base class for any 
object a collection of which can be sorted and printed.

Sortable has two pure virtual methods, compare and print. The compare method tells the object how to compare itself with 
another object. It returns true if the object it is being called from is smaller than the other object, and false 
otherwise. The print method allows the object to display itself.

Modify your Data class so that it operates on (pointers to) Sortable objects instead of int objects. You will first have 
to change int to Sortable*. You will also have to change your sort() method to use the compare() method of Sortable, and 
the print() method to use the Sortable's print() method. (Remember, you are not making Data inherit from Sortable! We are 
doing composition here, not inheritance.)

For this exercise, you are not provided any .cpp files in order to test your code yet. Testing your code will involve 
creating a class that extends Sortable and pushes some objects of that class into your Data object and trying to sort 
and print them. This is the goal of the next exercise.

Submit your modified Data class.
