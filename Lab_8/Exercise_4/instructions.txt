Sortable Objects III

This question is almost the same as the last one. You can reuse the files Data.h and Sortable.h. This time we will be 
storing objects of the Participant class. Each Participant has a name, an age, and a score. These are string, int, and 
double, respectively. To print a Participant simply print the name, age, and score separated by tab characters.

Participant objects should be ordered by score from highest to lowest. If two Participants have the same score then the 
younger of them takes priority and if they have the same score and the same age, simply order them alphabetically. 
You can test your code with the file sortingParticipants.cpp.
