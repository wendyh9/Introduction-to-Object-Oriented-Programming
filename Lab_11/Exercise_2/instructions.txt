Dynamic Array Iterator

Extend your DynArray class of the previous exercise such that the iterators.cpp file works correctly. You will need to 
create an iterator class for your dynamic array, with begin(), at_end(), advance(), and print() methods.

Provide your implementation in an updated dynArray.h file.
