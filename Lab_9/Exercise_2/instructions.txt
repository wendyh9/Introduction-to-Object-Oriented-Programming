Copy Constructors II

In the previous exercise where we were counting objects, there were 3 instances of the Object class being created. 
One of those was being created because we passed the object into the function f by value, creating a copy. Modify 
the function f so that this does not happen. Your program should report that there are 2 objects, not 3. Upload 
your modified version of objects.cpp.
